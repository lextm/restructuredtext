Linter
======

This article shows how the linter works.

doc8
----
The linter support is based on de facto tool called ``doc8``, which provides
the best-in-class rules for reStructuredText files.

Based on the configuration, this extension launches doc8 in the background to
scan the source files and reports back identified issues under ``PROBLEMs`` tab
(can be opened via ``View | Problems`` menu item).

To learn more about the settings, refer to :doc:`/articles/configuration`.
